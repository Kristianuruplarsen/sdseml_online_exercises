    "in your network, but before you go and report that to your boss you need to answer one crucial question: how does\n",
    "this result compare with a *random* one? In other words, how can you be so sure that this high number of triangles\n",
    "measured is not perfectly normal even in a random network of similar origin and therefore not very special after all? The answer: **you\n",
    "create a null model to compare your result with!**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: null models are a concept from the general field of statistics and therefore not just specific to\n",
    "networks. You can use this statistical tool anytime you need to assess how likely it is that your result is random.\n",

    "The most common type of null model is one where you shuffle links in your network, while preserving the degree\n",

    "not that much smaller? Can you still say your result is significant? Well, the trick (although computationally expensive\n",
    "as you will come to learn) is to do MANY comparisons. 1000 is not a bad start. For each comparison, you check if\n",
    "the number of triangles in your real data is bigger. After you have compared one thousand times you compute **the\n",

    "> **Ex. 10.2.1**: Assume you have a network where nodes and links tend to form lumps here and there. Imagine you now reach for your pen, and start labeling these nodes with group names (or ids) that feel appropriate according to how they are lumped together. If your partition is \"good\", nodes that are connected in groups should intuitively have the same label, while nodes that are distant and disconnected should have different labels. Modularity is a function that can be used to measure, by this logic, *how good* your partition is. It is in technical terms a *utility function*, and it looks like this:\n",

    "> Your job in this problem is to explain this equation. When I look at daunting math I find it calming to try and read it as if it were code. Since all math can be implemented in code, all math can be broken into parts, where each part does a seperate thing. Answer each question below seperately:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In code, a sum, $\\sum$, is like a `for` loop, where in every iteration you increment a variable. In the equation for modularity the little $ij$ subscript tells is what the sum is looping over (like `for ij in sumloop`). But what is $ij$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: i and j are nodes in the network. Thus, ij are node pairs. The summation tells us that we sum over all node pairs in the network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In each iteration of the sum, the delta function $\\delta(c_i, c_j)$ is used, where $c_i$ is the community label of node $i$. The delta function is a very simple program that returns 0 if the two input values are different and 1 if they are they same. How would you implement the delta function in code? What is it used for in the modularity equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: I would code up a separate function returning 1 if $c_i==c_j$. \n",
    "In the equation it has the property of discarding node pairs that are not in the same community \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the sum we use the term $\\frac{k_ik_j}{2m}$ as our *null model*. $k$ is the degree sequence (so $k_i$ is the degree of node $i$) and $m$ is the sum of all link weights. Explain what this null model measures. Could we have used other null models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: $k_ik_j$ is the number of ways in which node i and j can connect. This expression is then normalised by m to yield our null model $\\frac{k_ik_j}{2m}$, which expresses the expected weight between node i and j in a random network with a similar degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The sum subtracts the null model from $A_{ij}$ and adds the result to its final value if the delta function evaluates to 1. What is the point of only summing over this difference when the delta function is 1?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The term in the brackets allows us to get an impression of how the edge weights in the actual network differs from those of a random network. As we only want to assess connectivity within each community we only sum over nodes that are in the same community. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The sum term is normalized by $2m$. Why exactly $2m$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: This is a way of scaling by the possible number of connections in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Summarize your insight gained from answering the above questions. In your own words, explain how the modularity function works. Use 1-3 sentences.\n",
