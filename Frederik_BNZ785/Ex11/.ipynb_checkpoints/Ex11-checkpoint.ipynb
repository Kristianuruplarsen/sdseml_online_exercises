Once they are resistant they are essentially \"removed\" from the network, so this type of model works for diseases where people recover and gain resistance as well as ones that kill people, as niether type of person can transmit (measles, chickenpox but also rabies, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, etc.).\n",

Those with vaccines are a kind of doorstopper for that part of the network if it is a static network f.x., but if there are too few the infection can enter other clusters, stay there until the vacine wears off and then spread through the before secured part.
